# MusicHelper

### About

As taken straight from the about section on the site, the purpose of the MusicHelper ASP.NET MVC Web Application is as follows:

"At its core, the purpose for MusicHelper's existence is right there in the name. I set out to make this app as a way to help musicians of all level hone their craft. Whether you're just starting out, or have been playing for decades, this site exists to help eliminate aimlessly scrolling through the Internet in hopes you find a lesson that will accurately address what you are working on, at the time. I decided to also add on the tablature database, as well, so that way you have an immediate resource to apply the skills you learn in the lessons you find on the site.

That being said, this site also exists for you to help out your fellow musicians. Maybe you're not in search of knowledge, but come across something that you think someone else may find beneficial. That is also where we come in. So please, create an account, take a look around, and let's get to work building a stronger knowledgebase for all of our fellow musicians."

### Languages Used
- C# (*the coding language, not the musical note*)
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 3
- JavaScript

### Basic Features of the Website
Whether you are logged into an account or not, all users of MusicHelper have access to viewing Instrument, Lesson, and Tablature indexes, as well as viewing all details regarding those tables. All users also have the ability to filter through Lessons and Tabs by Instrument for quick reference. The purpose of the site is to help people learn, so I want to make sure everyone has that opportunity.

### Extended Features of the Website
That being said, not being logged in does have its limitations. Anyone who creates an account has instant access to the following:
- Adding, editing, and removing Instruments, Lessons, and Tabs.
- Favoriting Lessons & Tabs for quick reference.

### Roadmap
While nothing is ever truly finished, these are the immediate ideas that jump out to me when it comes to where to take the site going forward.
- [ ]  Altering the difficulty system from 1-10 to more of a list of levels (*i.e. "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced", etc.*)
- [ ]  Putting more emphasis on user profiles.
- [ ]  Adding admin roles for the sake of controlling instruments on the website.
    - [ ]  This would lead to the implementation of user recommendation for instruments to be added instead of them just adding them.
